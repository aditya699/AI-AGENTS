# Soap Demand Forecasting Model for 2025

## Project Description

Developed a machine learning model to forecast soap demand for the sales team in 2025.

## Methodology

A machine learning model was developed to forecast soap demand for the sales team in 2025. A random forest model was trained using an unspecified dataset. The resulting forecast was provided to the sales team in a CSV file.  No further details regarding data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection rationale, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation metrics, or error analysis are available.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Other Notes

* **Model:** Random Forest
* **Prediction Target:** Soap demand forecast for 2025
* **Output:** CSV file containing forecast results.
* **R-squared (R2):** 92%
