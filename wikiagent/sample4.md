# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Description

This project involved developing a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn (cancel service). The goal was to proactively contact these at-risk customers to address their concerns and improve satisfaction, thereby reducing churn.


## Methodology

**Project Goal:** Develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn and provide a list of at-risk customers to end-users.

**Phase 1: Model Development**

A random forest model was developed to predict customer churn.  The specifics of feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning are not detailed in the provided information.

**Phase 2: Prediction and Output**

The trained random forest model was used to generate predictions on a dataset of customers. The predictions, identifying customers likely to churn, were compiled into a CSV file for use by end-users.


**Deliverables:**

* **CSV file of predicted churned users:** A comma-separated value file containing a list of customers predicted to churn, based on the random forest model's output.


**Limitations:**

* The methodology lacks detail regarding data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation metrics, and the specific process used to generate the final CSV file. Further information is needed to fully assess the robustness and validity of the approach.


## Tech Stack

python, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib


## Other Notes

**Business Understanding:** Deeper exploration of customer churn drivers is needed. Understanding the reasons behind churn (e.g., pricing, customer service issues, competitor offerings) will help identify more relevant features for the predictive model. Qualitative data (e.g., customer feedback surveys, call center notes) should be considered to supplement quantitative data.

**Feature Engineering:** The current model relies on an unspecified feature set. Investigating additional features could significantly improve model accuracy. Examples include customer demographics, service usage patterns, billing history, customer support interactions, and contract details. Feature engineering techniques (e.g., creating interaction terms, deriving new features from existing ones) should be explored.

**Results Communication:** The CSV output is a good start, but more comprehensive reporting is necessary for effective communication. This should include:

* Model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) with clear explanations of their implications.
* Visualizations (e.g., feature importance plots from the random forest, ROC curve) to aid understanding.
* A business-oriented summary explaining the model's findings and recommendations for action. This should go beyond simply identifying at-risk customers and articulate the potential impact of proactive intervention (e.g., estimated churn reduction, cost savings).
* Documentation explaining the model's methodology, limitations, and assumptions.

**Technical Considerations:** While the use of Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib is appropriate, considerations should be given to model explainability and robustness. Techniques to improve these aspects should be investigated.

## Learning

This project focused on developing a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churning. The key takeaway was the critical importance of a strong understanding of the underlying business context when building such models. Overly focusing on model optimization without sufficient consideration for business realities can lead to overfitting and ultimately, a less effective solution. Optimizing a model repeatedly risks creating a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, reducing its practical value in predicting and mitigating churn.
