        Make sure the syntax is correct by validating it with the fact that [] is used for nodes and () is not used.Inside the brackets [] we should not use any other special characters or brackets().A Simple flow diagram is what is needed rather than styles and all just arrows and nodes.

        Do not add any other information to the mermaid chart.
