COVID-19 accelerated online purchases, especially for essentials, resulting in a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$ 2.3 billion in 2023, a 70% increase from the previous year. The industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of 27.9% from FY22 to FY27, reaching US$ 5.5 billion by 2025, with market share in online groceries expected to rise from 10% to approximately 45%.  \nSignificant players include Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Dunzo Daily, and new entrants like Zepto. Advanced technology such as algorithms, data analytics, route optimization, and automation is crucial for operational efficiency. The shift from central warehouses to micro-warehouses or dark stores facilitates quicker deliveries (10-20 minutes).  \nRetailers benefit from increased competition, customer loyalty, and valuable consumer data insights. Factors driving growth include new user adoption, event-driven sales, and category diversification beyond groceries to beauty, electronics, and more. Government initiatives such as Digital India, Start-up India, Skill India, and UPI support the expansion of quick commerce and enhance digital accessibility. However, future challenges involve managing delivery infrastructure costs and addressing sustainability issues in a price-sensitive market.Revenue in the Quick Commerce market in India is projected to reach US$5.38 billion in 2025, with an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2029) of 16.60%, leading to a projected market volume of US$9.95 billion by 2029. The number of users is expected to grow to 60.6 million by 2029, with user penetration increasing from 2.7% in 2025 to 4.0% by 2029. The average revenue per user (ARPU) is anticipated to be US$137.20.\n\nIn comparison, China will generate the highest revenue (US$92.68 billion in 2025) with a user penetration rate of 23.9%.\n\nDefinition: The Quick Commerce market includes online grocery delivery services that provide last-mile delivery or operate ghost stores with limited product selection for faster delivery, often delivering groceries in under 3 hours, with many advertising delivery in under 30 minutes.\n\nIn-scope includes online grocery orders with fast delivery and companies operating small stores (dark/cloud stores). Out-of-scope excludes local supermarkets that do not offer quick delivery, meal kit services, and ready-to-eat meal delivery services.\n\nKey factors driving the Quick Commerce market in India include increasing demand for on-demand delivery, smartphone penetration, and changes in consumer behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
