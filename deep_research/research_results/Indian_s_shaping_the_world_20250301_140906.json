    "https://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/january-february-2024/Pages/india-impact-on-global-health.aspx": "India is a major player in global health, supplying 60% of the world's vaccines and exporting them to over 170 countries, earning it the title of \"the world’s pharmacy.\" With a population exceeding 1.4 billion and a significant diaspora of over 18 million, India's cultural heritage fosters global connections that impact various sectors including health care.\n\nSince 2016, India has been a focal point for health research, with over 4,300 studies funded by prominent biomedical research organizations. The Fogarty International Center has supported over 30 diverse health studies in India between 2022 and 2023, covering topics like mental and women's health.\n\nIndia's pharmaceutical capabilities were underscored during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Serum Institute produced the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enhancing access for low-income countries. Traditional health practices like Ayurveda and yoga, managed by AYUSH, are gaining traction alongside conventional medicine, with recent studies showcasing effective treatments for conditions like filariasis.\n\nIn 2023, India emphasized a One Health approach at the G20 summit, which integrates health across people, animals, plants, and the environment. India's contributions extend beyond medical products to include a rich pool of healthcare talent and engagement in international health diplomacy, notably through its leadership of WHO's South-East Asia chapter.\n\nThe Indian diaspora plays a crucial role in shaping global health through their expertise and contribution to medical research. The synergy of traditional practices, pharmaceuticals, and a strong research ecosystem continues to enhance India's impact on global health initiatives.",

Lahneman, surveys the literature regarding diasporas and their societal influences over a four-month period. It identifies a significant growth in diasporic studies, marked by the emergence of journals specifically dedicated to this field, including \"Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies.\" \n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Definition and Characteristics**: The prevailing definition describes a diaspora as a group sharing common ethnicity or nationality, living in a host country, and maintaining ties to their homeland, often engaging in political actions. \n\n2. **Dynamic Behavior**: Diasporas are fluid and self-identifying; events can mobilize members towards political engagement or disengagement. They can also overlap, complicating the cataloging of diasporic groups.\n\n3. **Types of Diasporas**: Different origins such as migrants, refugees, exiles, expatriates, and minorities may use the term interchangeably in scholarship, despite having distinct characteristics.\n\n4. **Media Influence**: Advances in communication technologies promote diaspora mobilization by enabling connections to home countries and among diaspora members.\n\n5. **Political Influence**: Some diasporas exert organized influence in politics, significantly impacting local and international affairs, with economic clout observed among groups such as the Chinese and Indian diasporas.\n\n6. **Networking**: Many diaspora communities rely on networks to coordinate activities and influence political agendas.\n\n7. **Paths of Influence**: Diasporas engage in various effective political strategies, including influencing policies of home and host countries, supporting civic organizations, and, in some cases, engaging in criminal or insurgency activities.\n\n8. **Diasporic Associations**: Civic organizations play vital roles in diaspora dynamics, often operating independently or in alignment with governmental agendas.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of adopting a broad, flexible definition of a diaspora to include diverse categorization reflecting their complex nature. A significant recommendation is to conduct more comprehensive research that recognizes the potential for quiescent diasporas to become active, posing future security risks. \n\nIt also notes the relatively nascent nature of research on the intersections between diasporas, remittances, and terrorism—pointing out that while remittances can help economies, they might also finance extremist activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the report indicates that understanding diasporas requires extensive engagement with a variety of studies, concepts, and dynamic relationships that they maintain with their homelands and host nations. It calls for further exploration of the influence of technology on diaspora politics, and particularly the legitimization and effectiveness of diaspora influence on policy. The report serves as a roadmap for the Strategic Assessment Group to enhance their understanding and analysis of diaspora communities and their global implications.",

South Asians have significantly influenced societies, particularly in countries like Britain, where Indian cuisine has become widely appreciated. Notable South Asian writers have revitalized English literature, while Bollywood expands its influence globally.\n\nHistorically, European perspectives depicted India as stagnant, ignoring its rich intercultural exchanges and trading networks, particularly in Southeast Asia. Prior to European colonization, diverse Indian communities thrived, contributing to a multicultural world, especially in the Indian Ocean trading realm. The Gujarati community played a leading role in early global trade and established a diasporic presence well before the 19th century.\n\nWith the onset of British rule, Gujarati traders migrated to various regions, with some even influencing political proceedings in South Africa. However, much of the Indian diaspora consists of indentured laborers who faced severe hardships in plantations across the Caribbean, Mauritius, and Fiji following the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe United States now hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas, largely due to immigration reforms in 1965. Indians have made significant strides in professional sectors but still face social challenges and discrimination. Political representation remains minimal, though the Indian-American community is increasingly active in lobbying efforts.\n\nDespite achievements, the diaspora grapples with issues such as discrimination in various countries, particularly where demographic tensions exist. The narrative of the Indian diaspora is multifaceted and cannot be reduced to a singular success story shaped by elite experiences; it requires acknowledgment of the diverse backgrounds and struggles of its communities. The depiction of the diaspora in contemporary media often overlooks these complexities, necessitating a broader understanding of its historical and cultural significance.",

This ambition requires substantial enhancements to India's economic foundations, state institutions, and military capabilities. Despite India's impressive growth in recent decades, historical challenges such as an overly regulated economy, inadequate state capacity, and complex state-society relationships hinder its potential.\n\nTo transition into a great power, India must undertake comprehensive structural reforms to establish efficient markets, improve state functionality, and cultivate a robust partnership with the United States. The engagement with the U.S. is crucial for fostering India's economic growth, access to technology, and enhancing defense capabilities against regional rivals, particularly China.\n\nHistorically, India's foreign policy has been characterized as defensive, aimed at safeguarding democracy and development during the Cold War.
