However, questions arise about the sufficiency of these steps in ensuring India's global leadership in AI, with concerns about potential technological unemployment, particularly in low-value-added sectors.\n\nDespite the budget's focus on skilling, the Economic Survey 2024-25 emphasizes that a holistic approach requires robust institutional frameworks alongside education and training. The current funding of Rs 500 crore is insignificant compared to the investments by AI leaders like the US and China, and India's fragmented AI funding limits its ability to support foundational research. Reports indicate that India lags behind in research output and quality, highlighting the urgent need for sustained investment in AI infrastructure and talent retention.\n\nTo compete globally, India must focus on cutting-edge AI research rather than solely on applied skills. The ASPI report indicates that Indian universities are becoming mere skill centers rather than hubs for groundbreaking research. Additionally, the budget lacked explicit details on a cohesive governance framework necessary for balancing AI's potential and associated risks of labor displacement.\n\nThe Economic Survey proposes a collaborative framework involving government, private sector, and academia to foster inclusive AI adoption. However, the budget does not adequately address structural reforms or strategic vision, needing significant enhancements in research funding, industry-academia collaboration, and responsible AI governance.\n\nIn summary, while the Union Budget 2025-26 lays a foundation for AI expansion, it is insufficient for positioning India as a leader in the global AI landscape.
