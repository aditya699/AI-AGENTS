    "https://time.com/6297403/the-workers-behind-ai-rarely-see-its-rewards-this-indian-startup-wants-to-fix-that/": "**Summary:**\n\nThe article discusses Karya, a nonprofit startup in India, which aims to ensure that workers contributing to AI, especially in underrepresented languages like Kannada, benefit fairly from their labor. Currently, Karya employs individuals in rural Karnataka to transcribe and record audio, providing them with a significant wage of about $5 per hour, well above the minimum wage. \n\nChandrika, a teacher, demonstrates the app's impact, allowing her to earn more in a few hours than in a month of teaching. Workers receive immediate payment and potentially bonuses, and Karya provides a model that offers de-facto ownership of the data they produce, redirecting profits back to them whenever the data is resold.\n\nThe AI industry, particularly in India, has a history of exploiting cheap labor, yet the global value of this sector is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2022 to $17 billion by 2030. The current disparity in data work leaves many workers in poverty despite the high demand for datasets in various languages, particularly Hindi and English.\n\nKarya is distinct because it partners with local NGOs to ensure that jobs reach marginalized communities, thus promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth. CEO Manu Chopra believes this approach can effectively alleviate poverty, stating that the goal is to uplift 100 million rural Indians by 2030.\n\nCurrently, Karya has paid out approximately 65 million rupees ($800,000) in wages to around 30,000 workers and plans to expand its operations. Future projects include collaborations with prestigious institutions like Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at improving healthcare access through AI technology.\n\nThe benefits extend beyond income; workers also gain knowledge about public health issues, such as tuberculosis, which helps them in their communities. While the app caps earnings at $1,500 to ensure turnover for new workers, there are concerns about the overall sustainability and scalability of Karya's model. The organization also emphasizes ethical labor practices, refusing to engage in content moderation that could expose workers to trauma.\n\nChopra's background as a former Microsoft researcher and his journey from poverty to being educated highlight the mission behind Karya, driven by a desire to create a more equitable technology landscape. The startup's ethical framework and community focus could redefine how AI data is sourced and compensated, aiming to close the disparities faced by workers in the AI industry.",

This indicates that traditional workforce skills need upgrading to compete in the digital economy.\n\n3. **Professional Inadequacy**: A study from February 2025 found that 77% of Indian professionals feel inadequately skilled in technologies deemed essential by their employers.\n\n4. **Reskilling Needs**: Nasscom's 2022 report states that 50% of India's workforce (about 150 million people) requires reskilling or upskilling by 2025 to meet industry demands. Additionally, the demand for cloud professionals is projected to reach 3.9 million by 2025, while fewer than 1.5 million are currently available.\n\n5. **Challenges in Skill Assessment**: There are no standardized frameworks for assessing current skills against future job requirements. Many companies struggle with traditional talent management approaches, leading to poor alignment between employee capabilities and organizational needs.\n\n6. **Anticipated Job Changes**: The World Economic Forum predicts automation could displace 83 million jobs globally, while creating 70 million new ones, with many Indian workers lacking the necessary specialized training.\n\n7. **Sector-Specific Gaps**: The BFSI sector especially demands cybersecurity and data analysis professionals, with estimates indicating a need for 1 million cybersecurity experts by 2027, but currently, only about 300,000 professionals are available.\n\n8. **Collaboration for Solutions**: To address these issues, collaboration among businesses, government, and academia is essential. Recommended strategies include:\n   - Assessing skills gaps using AI-powered tools.\n   - Investing in continuous learning and development across industries.\n   - Developing a skills taxonomy for consistency in skill definitions.\n   - Aligning educational curricula with industry needs to ensure employable skills.\n   - Tracking the impact of training programs through real-time monitoring tools.\n\nIn summary, addressing India's skills gap crisis in the tech sector requires a collective effort to reskill the workforce, implement standardized frameworks, and foster collaborations between educational institutions and industry.",
