The Indian government's approach has oscillated between minimal oversight and more interventionist policies, leading to some confusion. Various stakeholders, including government branches and industry representatives, have differing views on the level of regulation needed.\n\nThe authors outline a framework for regulation that includes defining objectives, scope, and liability concerning AI systems. They suggest a risk-based approach, emphasizing the need for evidence-based classification of AI risks, which include malicious uses, algorithmic discrimination, transparency failures, systemic risks, and loss of control due to AI decisions. The paper highlights the necessity of utilizing existing laws to address many AI-related issues and suggests targeted amendments where current regulations fall short.\n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a policy action plan advocating for self-regulation in the immediate term while calling for the establishment of an AI Safety Institute to enhance state capacity. The importance of consultations with experts and a whole-of-government approach to develop a coherent regulatory framework is emphasized to enable India to harness the potential of AI while mitigating its risks effectively.",
