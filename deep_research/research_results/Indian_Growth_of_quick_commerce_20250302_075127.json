    "https://iipseries.org/assets/docupload/rsl2024FE134341F8F539D.pdf": "**Impact of COVID-19 on Adoption of Quick Commerce**\n\n**Authors:**  \n- Piya Ghosh, Professor, Universal Business School, Maharashtra, India  \n- Dr. Asha Bhatia, Director of Research, Universal Business School, Maharashtra, India  \n\n**Keywords:** Quick Commerce, E-Commerce, Indian Market, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, COVID-19  \n\n### Abstract\nCOVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation and significantly increased demand for quick commerce (q-commerce), a business model providing rapid delivery (10-30 minutes) of items, primarily food, stationery, and over-the-counter drugs. Traditional warehousing has shifted to micro-warehouses controlled by vendors, focusing on high-demand items for a faster shopping experience compared to standard e-commerce.\n\n### Literature Review\nDigital transformation is characterized by the organization-wide change prompted by digital technologies. It impacts IT infrastructure, corporate strategies, and stakeholder interactions. Big data analytics plays a key role in modern business performance. Recent trends indicate an increase in online grocery shopping as consumers adapt to rapid changes induced by the pandemic, leading to an unprecedented rise in q-commerce.\n\n### Comparison: Traditional E-Commerce vs. Q-Commerce\nQ-commerce is distinguished by its focus on speedy delivery, utilizing micro-hubs for last-mile delivery and offering a consumer experience based on speed, convenience, and customer satisfaction. Challenges include managing high delivery frequencies and urban logistics.\n\n### Indian Market Scenario\nThe Indian quick commerce market is expected to grow from $0.3 billion to $5 billion by 2025. Online grocery platforms are poised for significant growth, with consumers increasingly turning to digital shopping for convenience. Current players include Zomato, Swiggy, BigBasket, and Dunzo, with investment influx indicating strong competition and consumer demand.\n\n### Current Status of Q-Commerce in India\nQ-commerce predominantly services grocery needs, but there is a growing trend towards incorporating electronics, stationery, and pharmaceuticals. With a reach of over 20 million Indian households, q-commerce currently captures only 7% of the market, indicating substantial growth potential. Companies like Swiggy and Zomato are investing heavily in delivery services.\n\n### Future Prospects and Challenges\nThe logistics sector should monitor q-commerce trends. While rapid delivery methods are being adopted, long-term consumer habits regarding pricing and delivery expectations may stabilize around 30 minutes rather than 10. Safety and security remain concerns, with increasing incidents due to rushed deliveries. Nonetheless, q-commerce provides opportunities for businesses to cater to evolving consumer preferences.\n\n### Conclusion\nQ-commerce is reshaping consumer interactions with delivery services, providing an efficient means to acquire goods swiftly. The ongoing evolution in logistics and delivery systems will dictate future market dynamics, emphasizing the need for adaptability and emphasis on secure transactions. \n\n### Key Statistics and Insights\n- Q-commerce market in India expected to grow significantly by 2025.\n- Over 130 million households anticipated to adopt e-grocery platforms.\n- Investment trends reflect the increased acceptance of q-commerce among major companies.\n- Customer safety and delivery efficiency represent critical areas for development.\n\n### References\nThe report cites numerous studies and reports emphasizing the influence of COVID-19 on digital consumer behavior, logistics advancements, evolving market dynamics, and comparative studies between traditional e-commerce and q-commerce.",

    "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-commerce-reshaping-indian-consumer-behavior-getting-kapoor-s9cxf": "- **Consumer Buying Behavior**: Quick commerce is shifting consumer behavior from planned purchases to on-demand purchases, particularly for household essentials like groceries and personal care products. This shift is more significant for households that spend a smaller percentage of their budget on essentials and prioritize convenience.\n\n- **E-commerce Strategy for FMCG**: FMCG companies are earning up to 50% of their e-commerce revenue from quick commerce by forming direct agreements with q-commerce players, thereby streamlining supply chains and improving margins.\n\n- **Expansion Limitations**: Quick commerce is best suited for fast-moving consumer goods with high brand recognition and quick inventory turnover. Categories unsuitable for quick commerce include high-value items with infrequent purchases and bulky products due to impractical logistics costs.\n\n- **Loyalty in Quick Commerce**: Customer loyalty operates on two levels:\n  - **App-Level Loyalty**: Influenced by delivery times, product availability, and user experience. Consumers typically have a default app preference and often resort to a backup app if their primary choice lacks desired products.\n  - **Brand Loyalty**: Mirrors historical buying patterns where consumers were willing to alternate brands based on availability, indicating that quick commerce will adapt to consumer preferences over time.\n\n- **Strategic Insights**: The operational simplicity of working with fewer q-commerce players instead of numerous regional distributors is a significant advantage for brands. Quick commerce mirrors the traditional market dynamics of the past, where convenience and brand accessibility dictated purchasing decisions.\n\n- **Conclusions**: Quick commerce is both shaping and being shaped by consumer behavior, reflecting a mutual influence that defines the current market landscape in India.",

They called for government intervention to protect small retailers.\n\n- **Impact on Traditional Retailers**:\n  - Loss of Business: Traditional stores are experiencing reduced foot traffic as consumers shift to QCom platforms for convenience.\n  - Pricing Competition: QCom platforms can offer deep discounts due to heavy funding, making it difficult for traditional retailers to compete.\n  - Inventory Challenges: Traditional stores face high inventory levels due to reduced sales and delayed payments to distributors.\n  - Technology Gap: QCom utilizes advanced technology for inventory and logistics management, which traditional retailers struggle to match.\n\n- **Legal Complaints**: Following the concerns, AICPDF filed a complaint with the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) regarding potential FDI and competition law violations by QCom platforms.\n\n- **FDI Policy Context**: \n  - Marketplace e-commerce entities are allowed B2B transactions but cannot exercise control over inventory.\n  - Seller details must be disclosed, and delivery responsibility lies with the seller.\n  - Fair competition must be maintained, prohibiting marketplace entities from influencing prices.\n\n- **Alleged Violations**:\n  - Misuse of FDI Funds: Over INR 54,000 crore in FDI allocated largely for operational losses instead of infrastructure.\n  - Inventory Control: QCom platforms allegedly control inventory through preferred sellers, which may violate FDI regulations.\n  - Predatory Pricing: Deep discounts funded by FDI could undermine traditional retailer viability.\n  - Restricted Access: Exclusive seller agreements reduce competition and limit consumer choice.\n\n- **Regulatory Calls**: CAIT urged immediate regulatory measures to protect small traders and ensure compliance with existing laws, emphasizing the need to determine if the QCom model operates as an inventory-based e-commerce model.\n\n- **FAQs**:\n  - **QCom Model**: Delivers goods rapidly (10-15 minutes) utilizing hyperlocal supply chains and technology.\n  - **Impact on Kirana Stores**: Disrupted by reduced foot traffic, aggressive pricing, and inventory challenges.\n  - **Legal Concerns**: Include potential misuse of FDI funds, predatory pricing, and restricted market access.\n  - **Role of AICPDF/CAIT**: To address QCom challenges through complaints and advocacy for regulatory oversight.\n\n**Conclusion**: The quick commerce sector in India is at a regulatory juncture, with increasing scrutiny over its practices amid the rapid shift in consumer behavior towards convenience-driven purchasing.
