Fr. Augustine Mendonca emphasizes that marriage is viewed as a natural reality deeply influenced by socio-cultural conditions. He highlights Pope John Paul II's assertion that effective pastoral care of marriages and families requires awareness of their cultural milieu. The paper advocates for judges in ecclesiastical tribunals to appreciate the relevant socio-cultural aspects of marriage cases to ensure just decisions, especially regarding matrimonial consent. \n\nIt examines how cultural influences impact psychological factors, perceptions, and the notion of consent, particularly in arranged marriages.

This practice burdens the bride's family financially and can lead to crimes against women, including emotional abuse, violence, and even deaths related to dowry disputes. Despite the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 and subsequent legal measures aimed at curbing this practice, enforcement remains weak, and dowry-related violence persists, particularly in northern and eastern states.\n\nHistorically, the origins and prevalence of dowry vary, with early accounts suggesting limited practice. Various economic, social, and religious factors perpetuate the dowry system, leading to ongoing pressure on families, especially in higher social strata. The laws against dowry have often been criticized for inefficacy and potential misuse, with instances of abuse reported from both sides.

However, since then, the median dowry has remained stable despite variations in payment distribution. The article tests various theories explaining dowry, concluding that increased differentiation in groom quality, due to greater access to education and employment, is a primary factor for dowry inflation. Additionally, as the proportion of high-quality grooms increases, the dowry amounts for these grooms begin to decline.
