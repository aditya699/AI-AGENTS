    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_in_India": "The information technology (IT) industry in India comprises IT services and business process outsourcing (BPO), contributing 7.4% to India's GDP in FY 2022. The revenue of the IT-BPM sector is estimated at $245 billion for FY 2023, with domestic revenue at $51 billion and export revenue at $194 billion. The sector employs approximately 5.4 million people as of March 2023.\n\nHistorically, the foundation for India's IT sector began with the Bhabha Committee (1966-1975) and the establishment of Tata Consultancy Services in 1967, which led to the country's export of IT services. The first software export zone was set up in 1973 in Mumbai. Over the years, the sector evolved, with significant advancements in regulation and infrastructure like Software Technology Parks of India (STPI).\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing concern, potentially leading to automation that could disrupt job roles, particularly in the IT sector, with predictions of significant job losses by 2030. The industry faces high attrition rates due to various factors, including career growth issues, work-life balance, and competitive compensation.\n\nThe major IT hubs in India include Bengaluru, which is the largest, known as the \"Silicon Valley of India\"; Hyderabad, known for its HITEC City; Chennai, the third-largest exporter; Pune, developing rapidly in software services; and Kolkata, a significant hub in East India.\n\nTop Indian IT companies by market capitalization are Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, and Tech Mahindra. The industry has faced challenges including a notable presence of fraudulent activities such as fake experience certificates, and technical support scams, primarily affecting the industry’s reputation and operational integrity.\n\nOverall, the Indian IT sector is poised for growth but must navigate challenges related to automation, attrition, and fraudulent practices while maintaining its status as a key player in global IT services and exports.",

The summit provided India with a crucial platform to showcase its technological advancements, including its recent successful moon landing and the passing of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. To attract foreign investment and achieve its goal of a $1 trillion export-driven economy, India needs to streamline its regulatory landscape and enhance ease of doing business by adopting good regulatory practices.\n\nThe tech industry plays a vital role in advancing India's digital economy, and leveraging digital trade and services can significantly contribute to economic growth.
