Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse, varying significantly across its many regions due to differences in climate, soil, culture, and available ingredients (Wikipedia, Tavily).  This diversity is reflected in the wide array of spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits used, leading to a vast range of flavors and textures (Wikipedia, Tavily).  Religious and cultural practices, particularly Hinduism and Islam, also significantly influence food choices and preparation (Wikipedia).

Historical events, including invasions, trade, and colonialism, have shaped Indian cuisine, introducing new ingredients like potatoes, tomatoes, chilies, peanuts, and guava (Wikipedia).  In fact, the spice trade between India and Europe was a major driver of the Age of Discovery (Wikipedia).  Indian cuisine's global impact is evident in its influence on cuisines worldwide, including those of Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, and the Caribbean (Wikipedia).  The WWF's Living Planet Report even highlighted India's food consumption patterns as the most sustainable among G20 nations (Wikipedia).

While many dishes defining modern North Indian and Pakistani cuisine originated within the Indian subcontinent, many incorporate fruits and vegetables from elsewhere (Wikipedia).  Common ingredients across India include rice, wheat, ginger, garlic, green chilies, and a wide variety of spices (Wikipedia).  Dairy products like yogurt, ghee, and paneer are frequently used, adding richness and flavor (Tavily).
