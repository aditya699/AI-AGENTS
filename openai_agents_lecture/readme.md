# Notes on OpenAI Agents

## Components of Agents
- **Agents**: Combination of LLMs, tools, other functions, guardrails, and handoffs working together
- **Tools**: Python functions that extend agent capabilities
- **Other Functions**: Can be Python functions or other agents that provide additional functionality
- **Guardrails**: Security features and mechanisms to ensure responsible use
- **Handoffs**: Capability to transfer conversations to other agents when appropriate
